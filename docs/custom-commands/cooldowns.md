# Cooldowns

Cooldowns are essential to controlling how often a command is used and to avoid spam in chat.

## Global Cooldowns

Global cooldowns are the minimum frequency a command can be triggered by any user in chat. 

If a single user triggers a command, the **entire** chat must wait until the cooldown is over until this command can be triggered again.

## User Cooldowns

User Cooldowns are the minimum frequency a single user trigger a command. 

If User-A triggers a command they must wait X amount of seconds before they can trigger the command again. User-B can still trigger the command.
